## how to play

The game follows the regular _tic-tac-toe_
[rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) with a twist. There are
three players (one of the is the "AI"). Boards can be of any size between 3x3
up to 10x10. The rules are always to fill horizontal, diagonal or vertical rows
with the same symbol (owned by a player). Oh, and the symbols can be any valid
`UTF8` character.

Take turns by entering your desired position. For example: `1,3` would place
your symbol at __first row__ and __third column__. Invalid or out of range
input is ignored.
